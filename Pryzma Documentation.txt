Pryzma Programing Language Documentation

Introduction:

Pryzma is a simple programming language designed for ease of use and readability. It supports basic arithmetic operations, variable assignments, input/output operations, simple if statments, and simple flow control.

Syntax:

Variables:

Variables in Pryzma can hold numeric values or strings. Variable names must start with a letter and can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.

a = 10
name = "John"

Lists:

a = [1,2,3,4,5]

PRINT a[0]

output will be:

1

Type conversion:

varible = INT(varible)

or

varible = STR(1)

to get type of some varible you can do:

a = 1
b = TYPE(a)
PRINT b

it will print int

Arithmetic Operations:

Pryzma supports basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

result = 10 + 5
total = 2 * 3
difference = 8 - 4
quotient = 10 / 2

Input/Output:

Pryzma allows input from the user and output to the console. Concatenation is used to combine strings and variables for output.

INPUT age::"age:"
PRINT "Your age is: " + age

in input age is a varible that input will be asigned to  and "age:" is the prompt, if input will look like that:

INPUT age

then no prompt will be displayied

Flow Control:

Pryzma supports simple flow control using the STOP statement. It terminates the program execution.

STOP

or EXIT that exit the program

Loops:

FOR i, 1:5, PRINT i

output will be:

1
2
3
4
5

importing:

IMPORT file_path

after import you can use functions from the imported file

Comments:

Comments in Pryzma start with the # symbol and continue to the end of the line.

#This is a comment

If statments:

INPUT varible::"var1:"
INPUT varible2::"var2"
IF(varible,varible2,PRINT "true")

Functions:

declare function:

/function_name{command|command2|command3}

function body can have only one instruction

calling functions:

@function_name("text")

string text will be automaticly assigned to varible arg1,varibles also can be used as arguments like that:



/add{PRINT arg1}

a = "text"

@add(a)

CPRINT:

for example with program like that:

INPUT a
INPUT b
INPUT operator
c = a + operator + b
CPRINT c

and inputs like that 1, 2, + ,c will equal 1+2 and while printing it will be auto calculated and output will be 3

Loops:

FOR i, 1:5, PRINT i

it will print numbers from one to five

a=3

FOR i, a:5, PRINT i

it will print numbers from 3 to 5


Examples:

Example 1: Simple Arithmetic

a = 10
b = 5

sum = a + b
difference = a - b
product = a * b
quotient = a / b

PRINT sum
PRINT difference
PRINT product
PRINT quotient

Example 2: Input and Output

INPUT name

PRINT "Hello, " + name

Running Programs:

To run a Pryzma program, save the code in a text file execute it by lunching the
Pryzma interpreterand writing "file" command and providing a file path, or by lunching it from command line and  providing a file path sorunded  with " like that:

python Pryzma.py "file_path"
