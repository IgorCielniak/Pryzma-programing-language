Pryzma Programming Language Documentation

Introduction:

Pryzma is a simple programming language designed for ease of use and readability.

Syntax:

Variables:

Variables in Pryzma can hold numeric values or strings. Variable names must start with a letter and can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.

a = 10
name = "John"

Lists:

a = [1,2,3,4,5]

print a[0]

append a, "text"

it will append text to list a

POP a, "text"

it will pop text from list a

Type conversion:

variable = int(variable)

or

variable = str(1)

to get type of some variable you can do:

a = 1
b = type(a)
print b

it will print int

Len:
you also can do len like that:

a = "text"

print len(a)

it will print 4 ,you can also do:

a = [1,2,3,4,5]

print len(a)

it will print 5

Split:

b = "text text2"

print split(b)

it will print list of all works like that:

["text", "text2"]

Arithmetic Operations:

Pryzma supports basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

result = 10 + 5
total = 2 * 3
difference = 8 - 4
quotient = 10 / 2

Input/Output:

Pryzma allows input from the user and output to the console. Concatenation is used to combine strings and variables for output.

input age::"age:"
print "Your age is: " + age

in input age is a variable that input will be assigned to it and "age:" is the prompt, if input will look like that:

input age

then no prompt will be displayed

if there is \n in line it will print new line like in python,you can also do some think like that:

a = "text"

print a[1:-1]

it will print ex because it will remove one character form right and one from left


Flow Control:

Pryzma supports simple flow control using the STOP statement. It terminates the program execution.

stop

Loops:

for i, 1:5, print i

output will be:

1
2
3
4
5

importing:

use file_path

after import you can use functions from the imported file

Comments:

Comments in Pryzma start with the # symbol and continue to the end of the line.

#This is a comment

If statement:

input variable::"var1:"
input variable2::"var2"
if variable, variable2, print "true"

if variable one is the same as variable2 it will print true

input variable::"var1:"
input variable2::"var2"
IFN variable, variable2, print "true"
^^^
if variable will not equal variable2 it will print true

Functions:

declare function:

/function_name{command|command2|command3}

function body can have only one instruction

calling functions:

@function_name("text")

string text will be automatically assigned to variable arg1,variables also can be used as arguments like that:



/add{print arg1}

a = "text"

@add(a)

when calling a function at least one argument need to be passed even when it is not going to be use other wise you will get an error,for now calling a function with arguments in an if statment is impossible
to call a function without argument you can do

@add

cprint:

for example with program like that:

input a
input b
input operator
c = a + operator + b
cprint c

and inputs like that 1, 2, + ,c will equal 1+2 and while printing it will be auto calculated and output will be 3

Loops:

for i, 1:5, print i

it will print numbers from one to five

a=3

for i, a:5, print i

it will print numbers from 3 to 5

Exec function:

exec bash command

can be used like that:

exec echo Hello

Read and write:

content = read(C:\Users\User\Desktop\Untitled-1.txt)

content of file C:\Users\User\Desktop\Untitled-1.txt will be assigned to variable content

write(C:\Users\User\Desktop\Untitled-1.txt,content)

iw will write value of variable content to file C:\Users\User\Desktop\Untitled-1.txt

In:

a = [1,2,3]

b = in(a, 2)

print b

output will be True, you can also check if some string appear in list or if some word appear in string

Examples:

Example 1: Simple Arithmetic

a = 10
b = 5

sum = a + b
difference = a - b
product = a * b
quotient = a / b

print sum
print difference
print product
print quotient

Example 2: Input and Output

input name

print "Hello, " + name

Running Programs:

To run a Pryzma program, save the code in a text file execute it by lunching the
Pryzma interpreter and writing "file" command and providing a file path, or by lunching it from command line and  providing a file path sorunded  with " like that:

python Pryzma.py "file_path"
