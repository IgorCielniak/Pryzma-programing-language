Pryzma Programing Language Documentation

Introduction:

Pryzma is a simple programming language designed for ease of use and readability. It supports basic arithmetic operations, variable assignments, input/output operations, simple if statments, and simple flow control.

Syntax:

Variables:

Variables in Pryzma can hold numeric values or strings. Variable names must start with a letter and can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.

a = 10
name = "John"

Arithmetic Operations:

Pryzma supports basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

result = 10 + 5
total = 2 * 3
difference = 8 - 4
quotient = 10 / 2

Input/Output:

Pryzma allows input from the user and output to the console. Concatenation is used to combine strings and variables for output.

INPUT age
PRINT "Your age is: " + age

Flow Control:

Pryzma supports simple flow control using the STOP statement. It terminates the program execution.

STOP

Comments:

Comments in Pryzma start with the # symbol and continue to the end of the line.

#This is a comment

If statments:

default condition value is true to chang it assign new value to varible named if_condition, if i wont to vheck if input is equal to 1 i can do:

if_condition = "1"
INPUT varible
IF(varible,PRINT "true")

if input will be 1 it will print true

Examples:

Example 1: Simple Arithmetic

a = 10
b = 5

sum = a + b
difference = a - b
product = a * b
quotient = a / b

PRINT "Sum: " + sum
PRINT "Difference: " + difference
PRINT "Product: " + product
PRINT "Quotient: " + quotient

Example 2: Input and Output

INPUT name

PRINT "Hello, " + name

Running Programs:

To run a Pryzma program, save the code in a text file execute it by lunching the
Pryzma interpreterand writing "run from file" command and providing a file path
